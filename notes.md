capsystem notes
---------------

- I often want to parse commsystem messages myself, instead of having the overhead of the commsystem metadata
- I find that I wish to cache server capabilities in local boolean field variables
- It's confusing to use a capability with arguments, as I can't pass said arguments to Capsystem.hasCap(String)
- bukkit implementation needs a "broadcast message" that sends a capsystem message to broadcast
